# mern-stack-workout-app

A workout app made using MERN, following a [series of tutorials by Net Ninja](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9iJ_KkrkBZWZRHVwnzLIoUE).

I completed this series of tutorials in order to familiarise myself with the MERN stack for a group project in which we created a [Facebook clone (Acebook)](https://github.com/jillwones/acebook-mern) using MERN.
